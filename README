                     Nast - Network Analyzer Sniffer Tool       	  

	     	  	   	    README
============================================================================


Required libraries:		
===================	       

Libnet  1.1.1 (*)
Libpcap 0.8.1 (**)

(Pthread support)

(*)  www.packetfactory.net/libnet
(**) www.tcpdump.org


Raccomanded libraries:
======================

Libncurses (*)

(*) www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html


Installation:
=============

1) tar xvfz nast-x.y.z.tar.gz (*)
2) cd nast-x.y.z
3) ./configure (./configure --help for help)
4) make (make help for help)
5) make install (you must be root if you want to install in default prefix)

Read accepted options with "nast -h" and run with "nast [options]".
If you need help use manpage (nast(8)).

(*) x.y.z is the release version.

Ncurses, even they aren't necessary, are STRONGLY recommended for a better use 
of the plugins, specially TCP stream and byte counting!


Use:
====
The use of Nast under shell is quite easy and the man page should be enought.
The use of Nast with Ncurses graphical interface is a little bit more complex, 
so you should read the README_NCURSES for avoid problems (press "h" for
runtime help)!
