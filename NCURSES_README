============================================================================

Well, even if a lot of plugins are easy to use, some others are a little bit more
complex. I will show you how to use 'em:

--> USE HELP: Press "h" or select "Help" item from Options menu

Tcp stream: 1) press "Shift + A" to use the analyzer functions
            2) Select "TCP Stream" :-)
	    3) Insert the source and destination IPs (or the names if you have a DNS)
	       then press "Enter"
	    4) Use the "UP key" or "DOWN key" to select a connection from the DataBase
	       in the"Info Window"
	    5) Press "Enter" to see the stream
	       The stream will refresh itself when new data comes on the connection.    
	    6) If you want to see more lines in the "Main Window" press "q", then "F2"
	       and do as usual.
	    7) If you want to select another connection from the DataBase in "Info Window"
	       press "s" and go to point 4:)
	       
Reset connection:
	    1) Go to point 1 of TCP Stream and change "TCP Stream" with " Reset 
	       Connection":-)
	       
Sniffer options: 1) You MUST select the options of the sniffer (like "data", "hex" etc)
                    BEFORE start the sniffer. If you want to change a options you 
		    MUST restart the sniffer engine. 
	     
To stop applications as TCP Stream, Reset Connections and Byte Counting, use "Stop 
Application" under "Options".

That's all! Have fun;-)
